            <p>Hi! My name is John Doe and I'm a programmer.</p>
            <p>
                Web Development is my passion and that's what I do for living.
                I love creating something meaningful out of nothing, to experiment,
                to choose best solutions.

                I believe that sharing knowledge is our responsibility. It's something that moves the world forward.
                That's why this blog started. You'll find here tutorials, news and my personal thoughts on web and technology.
